# GPX Generator for Pokemon Go

Very simple and probably terribly coded GPX generator for Pokemon Go.

### How to use

1. Compile
2. Make a list of coordinates called `input.txt` on the same folder as the compiled file.
3. Copy and paste the output file `output.gpx` into the GPX portion of iSpoofer.
